    <h2>James</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Lee James Querido. I am from the Philippines but currently living in Japan. 
       My wife and I moved here to Japan in 2015. It has been a little over 7 years 
       but I still don’t speak the language fluently (Japanese is hard or I am just too lazy to learn). 
       I have two boys ages 7 and 3, who make my life exciting and adventurous.</p>
    <p>I like to play the guitar and listen to music whenever I have free time. 
       I also love playing basketball, swimming, and playing video games, 
       and I am starting to like snowboarding (started 2 years ago). </p>
    <p>I am an Assistant Language Teacher but hoping to switch my career to technology. 
       I am working on my 2nd degree at BYUI taking Applied Technology. 
       It’s been my dream to have a job in the technology field. </p>
    <p>I am a member all my life and have a scripture verse that reminds me to finish what I am tasked to finish 
       or reach my fullest potential through the help of the Lord. It is in 2 Nephi 3:15 
       “…As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness 
       until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.”</p>
